# React Design Patterns

This repository covers many of the most useful design patterns â€” effective and repeatable solutions to common application development challenges, ranging from preferred syntax for specific tasks to how to arrange components in the most effective way. Among the covered topics are composition, higher-order components, state hoisting, controlled vs. uncontrolled components, and many other patterns that help a React app develop into a well-organized codebase.
